# Install with uv (recommended - 10-100x faster)
uv add document-mcp

# For development with modern toolchain
uv sync
```

## Quick Start

### Document Structure

This MCP server treats "documents" as directories containing multiple "chapter" files (Markdown .md files). Chapters are ordered alphanumerically by their filenames (e.g., `01-introduction.md`, `02-main_content.md`).

```
.documents_storage/           # Root directory for all documents
├── my_book/                     # A document (directory)
│   ├── 01-introduction.md       # Chapter 1 (alphanumeric ordering)
│   ├── 02-main_content.md       # Chapter 2
│   ├── 03-conclusion.md         # Chapter 3
│   └── _manifest.json           # Optional: For future explicit chapter ordering
└── research_paper/              # Another document
    ├── 00-abstract.md
    ├── 01-methodology.md
    └── 02-results.md
```

### Setup for Claude Code

**Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)**

1.  **Install the package:**
    ```bash
    pip install document-mcp
    ```

2.  **Add to Claude Code automatically (recommended: local scope):**
    ```bash
    claude mcp add document-mcp -s local -- document-mcp stdio
    ```

3.  **Verify installation:**
    ```bash
    claude mcp list
    ```
    You should see `document-mcp: ... - ✓ Connected`

**Option 2: Manual Configuration**

If the automatic method doesn't work, use manual configuration:

1.  **Install and find the binary path:**
    ```bash
    # Install the package
    pip install document-mcp
    
    # Find where it's installed (try these commands in order):
    which document-mcp
    # If not found, try:
    python3 -c "import subprocess; print(subprocess.check_output(['which', 'document-mcp']).decode().strip())"
    # If still not found, try:
    python3 -c "import document_mcp, os; print(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(document_mcp.__file__), '..', '..', '..', 'bin', 'document-mcp'))"
    ```

2.  **Add MCP server configuration:**

    Add this configuration to your MCP settings file:
    - **Claude Code/Cursor:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
    - **Claude Desktop:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (on macOS)

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "document-mcp": {
          "command": "document-mcp",
          "args": ["stdio"],
          "env": {}
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **If `document-mcp` is not in your PATH**, use the full path you found above:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "document-mcp": {
          "command": "/full/path/to/document-mcp",
          "args": ["stdio"],
          "env": {}
        }
      }
    }
    ```

**Option 3: Development Installation**

For development or if you're working from source:

1.  **Clone and install:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/clchinkc/document-mcp.git
    cd document-mcp
    pip install -e .
    ```

2.  **Find the development binary:**
    ```bash
    python3 -c "import sys, os; print(os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'bin', 'document-mcp'))"
    ```

3.  **Add using the full path (local scope):**
    ```bash
    claude mcp add document-mcp -s local -- /path/to/your/venv/bin/document-mcp stdio
    ```

### Troubleshooting Claude Code Integration

**Common Issues:**

- **"spawn document-mcp ENOENT" error**: The binary is not in your PATH. Use Option 2 with the full path.
- **Connection timeout**: Verify the server starts correctly: `document-mcp --help`
- **Permission errors**: Ensure the binary has execute permissions: `chmod +x /path/to/document-mcp`
- **Module not found**: Reinstall the package: `pip uninstall document-mcp && pip install document-mcp`

**Quick Troubleshooting:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Can't find document-mcp command" | Use full path: `/path/to/document-mcp` in config |
| "Connection timeout" | Restart Claude Code and check `claude mcp list` |
| "Document not found" | Check exact document name - names are case-sensitive |
| "Chapter already exists" | Use different chapter name or delete existing one first |

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Test the binary directly
document-mcp --help

# Test with python module  
python3 -m document_mcp.doc_tool_server --help

# Check Claude Code integration
claude mcp list
```

### Setup for Other MCP Clients

For other MCP-compatible clients, use the same configuration with your client's specific config format. The server supports both `stdio` and `sse` transports.

## Quick Start Guide

### Your First Document (3 Simple Steps)

**Step 1: Create a Document**
```
"Create a new document called 'My Project'"
```

**Step 2: Add Content**
```
"Add chapter '01-intro.md' to 'My Project' with content: 
# Introduction
This is my project guide."
```

**Step 3: View Results**
```
"Show me the full document 'My Project'"
```

### Essential Commands You'll Use

**Document Management:**
- `"Create a new document called 'Project Name'"`
- `"List all my documents"`
- `"Delete document 'Old Project'"`

**Adding Content:**
- `"Add chapter '01-intro.md' to 'Project Name' with content: [your text]"`
- `"Append paragraph 'New content here' to chapter '01-intro.md' in 'Project Name'"`

**Viewing Content:**
- `"Show me document 'Project Name'"`
