# Quality Assurance (Multi-Agent Parallel)

**Test Suite Optimization**: Review entire test suite (unit/integration/e2e) for coverage, dependencies, and purpose. Standardize fixtures/mocks per framework conventions. Evaluate test criticality, correct errors/workarounds, remove excessive comments. Maintain simplicity, avoid over-engineering.

**Implementation Cleanup**: Organize project structure, tidy code, remove redundancies while maintaining simplicity. Focus on clean architecture, readable code organization, and elimination of technical debt without adding unnecessary complexity.
