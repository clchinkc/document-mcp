# Deep Research & Analysis

**Multi-Agent Research Loop**: Research → Ultrathink → Write → Review workflow with specialized agents to gather comprehensive information and continuously improve analysis.

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Research
Use specialized agents (opus-researcher, behavior-analyst, security-auditor, performance-optimizer) to:

**Documentation Analysis:**
- Review all documentation in target folders and entire codebase
- Analyze architecture decisions, design principles, and system requirements  
- Identify documentation gaps, inconsistencies, or outdated information
- Research external dependencies, frameworks, and best practices

**Code Architecture Review:**
- Examine all implementation files for fundamental principles and concrete implementation patterns
- Understand system design: complexity vs. usefulness vs. extensibility trade-offs
- Identify premature optimization, overly complex configuration, unnecessary fallbacks
- Map data flow, component relationships, and integration points
- Mark exact code locations for reference (file:line format)

**Testing Infrastructure Analysis:**  
- Review all test files for purpose, pass/fail conditions, and coverage gaps
- Analyze testing strategy effectiveness and identify areas for improvement
- Evaluate test reliability, performance, and maintenance overhead
- Consider how to ensure implementation correctness with optimal resource usage

## Phase 2: Continuous Improvement Loop
**Iterative Analysis Process:**
1. **Research**: Gather information using multiple specialized agents
2. **Ultrathink**: Deep analysis, critique, and evaluation of findings
3. **Write**: Document insights, patterns, and recommendations
4. **Review**: Validate findings with different agent perspectives
5. **Iterate**: Loop back to research with refined focus areas

**Output Requirements:**
- Record entire process and final analysis in separate documentation folder
- Never modify existing documents during research phase
- Reference exact code locations without copying code snippets
- Maintain research trail for future reference and validation

## Phase 3: Synthesis & Planning
**Multi-Perspective Analysis:**
- Product Manager: Business value and user impact assessment
- System Architect: Technical architecture and scalability review
- Senior Developer: Implementation quality and maintainability analysis  
- QA Engineer: Quality assurance and testing strategy evaluation
- Security Auditor: Security vulnerabilities and privacy compliance
- Performance Optimizer: Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

**Final Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive research report with all findings
- Prioritized improvement recommendations
- Implementation gap analysis
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
