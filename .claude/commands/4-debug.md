# Debug & Root Cause Resolution

**Investigation Phase**: Analyze current issues/errors/failures/warnings by examining code, documentation (@CLAUDE.md), and conducting web research for solutions. Ultrathink root causes and propose fix plans that minimize implementation complexity while maintaining core functionality.

**Resolution Phase**: Fix code with strict testing standards - no error tolerance, test skipping, or compromised test effectiveness. Maintain testing purpose, avoid over-engineering, minimize code modifications, ensure solutions address root causes not symptoms.
