4. Debug
4a. Debug Plan
Investigate into the current issues/errors/failures/warnings while looking into the code and document, including @CLAUDE.md . Or do web search if you think there will be information online.
Ultrathink about the root cause and then propose fix plan to fix any implementation logic error. Minimize the implementation complexity while maintaining useful core functionality. Don't write any code yet.
4b. Debug Fix
Fix the code accordingly. Maintain strict testing standards; do not tolerate any errors, or any skip only to avoid errors, that could compromise the effectiveness of the tests. Remember the purpose of testing. Avoid over-engineering and don't add uncessary complexity. Keep code modifications to a minimum.
