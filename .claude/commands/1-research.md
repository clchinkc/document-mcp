# Research (Multi-Agent Parallel)

**Implementation Analysis**: Examine all implementation files (src/) for fundamental principles, concrete patterns, and system design. Focus on complexity vs. usefulness vs. extensibility trade-offs, architectural decisions, and code quality patterns.

**Testing Analysis**: Review all test files (tests/) for testing purpose, pass/fail conditions, coverage gaps, and effectiveness. Optimize testing strategy to ensure implementation correctness with minimal resource usage and maximum reliability.
